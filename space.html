            Space does not begin at a specific altitude above the Earth, but the Kármán line at 100 km is a commonly used definition.<br>
The temperature in the void of space is about −270.45 °C.<br>
Space is a hard vacuum, meaning it is a void containing very little matter.<br>
There is no sound in space because molecules are too far apart to transmit sound.<br>
The space between galaxies is not completely empty but has an average of one atom per cubic meter.<br>
There are an estimated 100-400 billion stars in our galaxy, the Milky Way.<br>
The universe is observed to be 13.8 billion years old and has been expanding since its formation in the Big Bang.<br>
In the observable universe there are an estimated 2 trillion (2,000,000,000,000) galaxies.<br>
