        <P>This is a site that I have made for my coding project in my design class at St Thomas high school. We have worked over this past term learning all about many things like positioning, box models, fonts, colors, all the different tags that we had to use to make everything well an organized, and many more. I think that this project is really good for me to do because I have a good understanding of coding now and I will be able to advance my knowledge of coding and use it to make more advanced websites in the future, and maybe it can even turn into a job opportunity in the future.</P>
