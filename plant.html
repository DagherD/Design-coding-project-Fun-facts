            There are some 320,000 species of plants, found on all continents, even Antarctica. Since more are discovered every year, that number will increase over time.
<br>90 % of the foods people eat come from just 30 plants, yet there are over 80,000 edible plants in the world.
<br>The typical mature tree can provide enough wood to make 170,100 pencils.
<br>Cabbage, broccoli, kale, cauliflower and kohlrabi are all the same species of plant (Brassica oleracea), but were selectively bred for different uses, to the point where they no longer even resemble one another.
<br>Amber is fossilized resin from ancient trees.
<br>If apples float, it’s because they contain a lot of air: 18% air or more.
<br>The smell of freshly-mown grass is actually a plant distress call.
<br>The fastest-growing plant is the world is Burmese bamboo (Bambusa burmanica). It can grow up to 91 cm (35 in) per day. That’s almost 4 cm (1.5”) an hour. You could actually watch it grow.
<br>If onions make you cry when you chop them, it’s because they give off sulphenic acid, a serious irritant, when you cut them.
<br>The word banana comes from the Arabic word banan and means finger and was given because of the fingerlike fruit. And a cluster of bananas is called a hand.
